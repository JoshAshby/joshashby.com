Well, here it is! I decided that Wordpress wasn't quite right for what I do,
and the small amount of posts I get around to putting up each year. As a result
I've rebuilt my site to use [Board](https://github.com/JoshAshby/board) and
[v3 of Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)! Pretty exciting, if you ask me.
But then again no one *did* ask me so...  
  
I hope to get everything moved over, and some new content up soon, but it's a
long process to move all my posts and what not; So far I have a few various
projects, and my Pawnee trip up. Hang tight for more over the next few months!
