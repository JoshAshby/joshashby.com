#Who am I?

Just an average university student who loves to program and work with some
electronics in my free time. I mostly program in Python however have been
expanding into C++ and Clojure recently, along with PHP.  
Recently I've been completing my second summer internship at SparkFun Electronics
in Boulder, CO as a software developer intern.
